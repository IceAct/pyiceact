# pyiceact
Python Module for iceact data analysis


## Installation

We need the `pyeventio` package, which is currently not on PyPI.
Install first:
```
pip install https://github.com/fact-project/pyeventio/archive/v0.2.1.tar.gz
```

Then install this package:
```
pip install https://github.com/IceAct/pyiceact/archive/master.zip
```

## Developing

If you want to develop, clone the repo and run

```
pip install -e .
```
inside, this will install the package in developement mode, so changes
to the source file take effect without having to reinstall the module.
